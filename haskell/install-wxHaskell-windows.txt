There are essentially two versions of wxWidgets:
  1. 2.8.x (maintenance version) --- this is the version of choise
  2. 2.9.x (plenty of new things)

And consequently there are two versions of wxHaskell that supports different versions of wxWidgets:
  1. 0.13 wrapping wxWidgets 2.8.x (maintenance version)
  2. 0.90 wrapping wxWidgets 2.9.x

[ Installation ]

[ 1]. Prerequisites
  - Install MinGW
    from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/]
    into [C:\Bin\MinGW]
    - C++ Compiler
    - Developer Toolkit
  - Copy wx-config.exe
    from [http://wx-config-win.googlecode.com/svn/binary/wx-config.exe]
    into [C:\Bin\wx-config]
  - Install wxWidgets for Windows
    from [http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxMSW-2.8.12-Setup.exe]
    into [C:\Bin\wxWidgets-2.8.12]
  - Install wxPack with `MinGW GCC Only` option
    from [https://github.com/rjpcomputing/wxpack/wiki]
    into [C:\Bin\wxWidgets-2.8.12] (libraries sources path)
  - Set environment variables:
    - WXCFG=gcc_dll\mswu
    - WXWIN=C:\Bin\wxWidgets-2.8.12
    - PATH=...;C:\Bin\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin;C:\Bin\wx-config;C:\Bin\wxWidgets-2.8.12\lib\gcc_dll

[ 2]. Install wxHaskell
  - cabal update
  - cabal install wx-0.13.2.3

[ Notes ]

Mind the Gaps…
a) For some reason, when I first tried to run theHello.hstest program, I was greetedwith some ‘
mingwm10.dll
’ error nonsense. This was solved by making the following‘additional’ append to the
PATH
variable (see Section2.3for details on how to dothis):
C:\Program Files\Haskell Platform\2010.2.0.0\mingw\bin
b) If you want to avoid any nasty ‘
can’t load .so/.DLL for: std c++
’ tantrums, Irecommend using GHC (as opposed to GHCi) to compile your wxWidgetsexecutables, eg:
> ghc –package wx Hello.hs –o hello
…or, if you don’t want the annoying
Command Prompt
popping up every time yourun your executable:
> ghc–optl-mwindows–package wx Hello.hs –o hello
